module Y2Network
  # This class represents an IP address
  #
  # The IPAddr from the Ruby standard library drops the host bits according to the netmask. The
  # problem is that YaST uses a CIDR-like string, including the host bits, to set IPADDR in ifcfg-*
  # files (see man 5 ifcfg for further details).
  #
  # @see ConnectionConfig::IPConfig
  # @see https://www.rubydoc.info/stdlib/ipaddr/IPAddr
  #
  # @example ::IPAddr from the standard library behavior
  #  ip = IPAddr.new("192.168.122.1/24")
  #  ip.to_s #=> "192.168.122.0/24"
  #
  # However, what we need is to be able to keep the host part
  #
  # @example Y2Network::IPAddress behavior
  #   ip = IPAddress.new("192.168.122.1/24")
  #   ip.to_s #=> "192.168.122.1/24"
  #
  # @example IPAddress with no prefix
  #   ip = IPAddress.new("192.168.122.1")
  #   ip.to_s #=> "192.168.122.1"
